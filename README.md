# inputvalform

updatedform.jsp is our HTML form and created by Luqmanulhakim.
styles.css was also created by Luqmanulhakim.

Client side validation with javascript was collaborated by Luqman and Amir Izzat.

Server side validation, validate.jsp was made by Kamiel.

*ISSUES*

Phone number regular expressions do not want to work on validate.jsp.
Difficult to send a notification back to the input form without utilising another jsp page which
will burden performance.
